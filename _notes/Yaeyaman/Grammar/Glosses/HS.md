# Hearsay evidential particle

Using this label for hearsay evidentiality, marked in Yaeyaman by sentence final particles (using the more specific label rather than the generic SFP or EVID). Often found at the beginning and end of fictional narratives (for example, translations of the "run away goat" story, children's stories, etc.) 

By dialect:

- 小浜: *=tee* or *=dee*. As elsewhere in the language, the voicing of the initial consonant is difficult to determine, and may vary.
- 鳩間: *=ttuu*
