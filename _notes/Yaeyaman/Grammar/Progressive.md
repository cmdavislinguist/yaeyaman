There are two distinct ways of marking progressive aspect in Yaeyaman, which I term *analytic* and *synthetic*. 

The analytic construction consists of the *-i* infinitival verb form (the *ren'you* form) and the animate existential auxiliary verb, variously *uru*, *buru*, *buu*. The auxiliary expresses progressive aspect (and is hence glossed [[PROG]]), and also hosts tense suffixes. In particular, it can host the [[PRS]] suffix *-tu* and the [[PST]] suffix *-ta*. (Other possibilities should be noted as they arise.) 

Should be able to find these by searching for [[PROG]]-[[PRS]] and [[PROG]]-[[PST]] in the glosses.

One issue that arises is the interaction of these constructions with honorification; the auxiliary [[PROG]] verb is also the locus of suppletive honorification, and the synthetic progressive also can incorporate honorific morphology as well.
